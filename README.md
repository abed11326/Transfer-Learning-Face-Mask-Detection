# Transfer-Learning-Face-Mask-Detection
This is a transfer learning real time face mask detection project. The project uses the face detector classifier from OpenCV and a pre-trained CNN deep learning model that detect whether a given face wears a mask or not. The model is trained and derived from: https://github.com/Karan-Malik/FaceMaskDetector. It is then applied with OpenCv on live images from webcam.
